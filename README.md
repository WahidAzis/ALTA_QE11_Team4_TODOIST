         parameters, and expected responses.
      b. Identify the key features and functionalities to be tested.
      c. Define test objectives, test scenarios, and test cases based on the API requirements.

    > Testing Phase:
      a. Manual testing
         Manual testing will be completed in the first phase. This will involve manually sending 
         requests to the API and verifying the responses.
   
      b. Automation testing
